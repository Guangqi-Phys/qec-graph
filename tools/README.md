# Repository tools

Helper scripts run from the repository root. They are development/release
tooling, not part of the installed `qecgraph` package.

| Group | Scripts | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Reproduction | `reproduce.py`, `reproduce_workspace.py`, `reproduce_mcp.py`, `reproduce_golden.py`, `reproduce_incremental.py`, `reproduce_installed.py` | End-to-end regressions for the core, workspace, MCP, pinned sources, incremental mode and installed package |
| Isolation | `reproduce_isolation.py`, `reproduce_linux_isolation.py`, `mcp_isolated_macos.py` | OS-level MCP isolation checks |
| Release | `check_distribution.py`, `qec-graph.spec` | Distribution metadata checks and PyInstaller spec |
| Performance | `bench.py` | Generated incremental workload and pinned-source benchmark |
| Lean (deferred) | `reproduce_lean.py`, `reproduce_lean_checks.py`, `reproduce_lean_mapping.py` | Historical/experimental Lean evidence only; not a supported workflow |

The standard gates are:

```sh
python tools/reproduce.py --out build/reproduce
python tools/check_distribution.py dist
```

`tools/reproduce_*` scripts write machine-readable reports to `build/`; the
`validation/` tree keeps selected historical reports by functional area.
